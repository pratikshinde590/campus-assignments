Project Management Assignment

Introduction:
In this assignment, you are required to break down an epic related to a mortgage loan application platform into features and write detailed user stories. This exercise aims to evaluate your understanding of product management and project management principles, as well as your ability to translate high-level requirements into actionable tasks.

Epic:
Title: Enhance Mortgage Loan Application Platform with Consumer Loan Approval Feature

Description:
The goal of this epic is to add a new feature to our mortgage application platform that allows consumers to get approved for a loan. This includes providing an interface for consumers to input their details, an interface for consumers to upload documents, a system to evaluate eligibility for the loan based on the provided details and uploaded documents, and notifications to both consumers and loan officers about the approval status.

Task:
You must decompose the given epic into features and write user stories for each feature. Each user story should follow the format: As a <user role>, I want <goal> so that <reason>. Also, include acceptance criteria for each story in the format of Given, When and Then.

Steps to Implement:

1. Identify Features:
   Break down the epic into smaller, manageable features. For example:

2. Write User Stories:
   For each identified feature, write detailed user stories that capture the functionality from a end user perspective.

3. Define Acceptance Criterias:
   Specify clear acceptance criteria for each user story to ensure the feature meets the requirements.
